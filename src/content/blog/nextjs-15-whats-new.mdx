- **Middleware Improvements**: More powerful and flexible middleware capabilities

## Getting Started with Next.js 15

To create a new Next.js 15 project:

```bash
pnpm create next-app@latest my-app
```

Configure your project with:
```bash
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? Yes
✔ Would you like to use ESLint? Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? Yes
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory? Yes
✔ Would you like to use App Router? Yes
✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? Yes
```

## Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from Next.js 14, here are the key steps:

1. Update your dependencies:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^15.0.0",
    "react": "^18.3.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.0"
  }
}
```

2. Run the installation:
```bash
pnpm install
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Server Components
Use server components by default:
```tsx
// app/page.tsx
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetchData() // Server-side data fetching
  return <main>{/* Your component JSX */}</main>
}
```

### 2. Route Handlers
Take advantage of improved route handlers:
```tsx
// app/api/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  const data = await getData()
  return Response.json({ data })
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 represents a significant step forward in the evolution of the framework, offering better performance, enhanced developer experience, and improved security features. Whether you're building a small application or a large-scale project, Next.js 15 provides the tools and optimizations you need for success.
